# FlashMeForReal

A tool to compile a collection of SVG flashcards into printable double-sided
PDFS. Mainly targeting business sized perforated cards. See [this](https://www.amazon.com/Hamilco-Blank-Business-Cards-Stock/dp/B07L8LB741) for an
example of the input card stock to use.

The application uses PHP and Typscript, with WAMP as the target deployment server.

For example generated PDFS, see [here](https://pixeleuphoria.com/blog/index.php/media/#Flashcards).

* Pages come in pair and are expected to be printed double-sided.
* Perforated stock cards are suggested. Make sure your printer can handle thick paper.

Note that some of the PHP files expect the [Cards](https://github.com/Reavenk/Cards) submodule to be checked out.
